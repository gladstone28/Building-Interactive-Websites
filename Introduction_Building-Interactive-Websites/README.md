# Introduction: Building Interactive Websites

**In this unit, you will learn how to use JavaScript to build interactive websites.**

The goal of this unit is to learn how JavaScript is used to add interactive experiences to a website.

After this unit, you will be able to:

- Add JavaScript to a website for interactivity
- Describe what the DOM is
- Explain what DOM Events are
- Create forms using HTML and validate them using JavaScript

You will put all of this knowledge into practice with an upcoming Portfolio Project. You can complete the Portfolio Project either in parallel with or after taking the prerequisite content — it’s up to you!
